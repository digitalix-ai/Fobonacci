# Fobonacci
My solution of a simple Fibonacci numbers generator

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous sequence of numbers, often used in mathematics, computer science, physics, and elsewhere.
It is characterized with the property, that every consecutive number is equal to the sum of the previous 2 numbers, while 
the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1.
Here you can use the simple program I wrote to generate consecutive Fibonacci numbers in a chosen by you range, which you
need to specify in the brackets at the call of the function 'fib()'. As it is, the program generates the first 22 numbers
of the sequence. Note, that the numbers generated will always be +2 onto the specified range, because the first 2 numbers
are initially set up in the function and are not being generated. So even if you specify just 0 as a range, the numbers
0 and 1 will still be shown as a result.
